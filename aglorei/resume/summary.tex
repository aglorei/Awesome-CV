I believe in technology’s ability to make a real difference—and in building work that actually matters to the people creating it. Over the years, I’ve done everything from writing code to leading massive programs, selling big ideas, and coaching teams through the chaos of growth. Along the way, I’ve built deep technical chops and a strong instinct for navigating complex organizations, all while keeping people at the center. As AI reshapes how we build and solve problems, I’m focused on staying grounded in solid engineering principles and leading with an advocacy-first mindset—because tech should serve people, not the other way around.
